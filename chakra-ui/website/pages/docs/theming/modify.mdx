description: Documentation on how to modify the theme of Chakra components.

Chakra's theming system is quite simple for modifying styles of existing Chakra
components (`Box`, `Tabs`, `Accordion`, etc). The basic methodology is such that
you inherit the styles from the existing Chakra theme, and then provide a series
of overrides. This means that whenever you upgrade to a new version of Chakra,
you won't need to migrate all your existing styles to the new theme file.

## Modifying a single component

If we want to modify the styles of components that come with Chakra, we must
first install the default Chakra theme and then create a main `theme.js` (or
`theme.ts`) entrypoint file:

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/theme@next

# or

yarn add @chakra-ui/theme@next
```

```jsx live=false
// theme.js
import theme from "@chakra-ui/theme"

export default theme
```

You can then later import this theme inside of your main `ChakraProvider`
component at the root of your project:

```jsx live=false
// App.js
import React from "react"
import { ChakraProvider } from "@chakra-ui/core"

import theme from "./theme"

function App() {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider resetCSS theme={theme}>
      <App />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

Fantastic! But we're not doing anything with this theme. First, make sure you
have `@chakra-ui/utils` installed:

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/utils@next

# or

yarn add @chakra-ui/utils@next
```

Then, let's override the default `fontSize` of the Chakra `<Button>` component:

```jsx live=false
// theme.js
import theme from "@chakra-ui/theme"

// 1. Import the merge function from @chakra-ui/utils
import { merge } from "@chakra-ui/utils"

// 2. Define the changes you want to make for the button
const Button = {
  baseStyle: {
    fontWeight: "bold", // Normally, it's "semibold"
  },
}

// 3. Import the Button styles into the theme.components object
const overrides = {
  components: {
    Button,
  },
}

// 4. Export the merge between the default theme at @chakra-ui/theme, combined with your overrides
export default merge(theme, overrides)
```

And that's it!

## Modifying the theme

Not only does this apply to components, but you can also override the core theme
settings themselves. For future reference, Chakra calls these settings the
theme's "foundations". In short, they define the borders, colors, type styles,
drop shadows, and other styles that you can reference from Chakra components.

For instance, let's say that I want to modify what borders are available to me
in my project. Following the same logic as before, I could add another border to
the existing set of borders like such:

```jsx live=false
// theme.js
import theme from "@chakra-ui/theme"
import { merge } from "@chakra-ui/utils"

/*
  Remember, borders already contains the following keys:

  const borders = {
    none: 0,
    "1px": "1px solid",
    "2px": "2px solid",
    "4px": "4px solid",
  }
*/

const overrides = {
  borders: {
    "8px": "8px solid",
  },
}

/*
  This will produce:

  const borders = {
    none: 0,
    "1px": "1px solid",
    "2px": "2px solid",
    "4px": "4px solid",
    "8px": "8px solid",
  }
*/
export default merge(theme, overrides)
```

And now, we can use that `border` definition in any component we'd like:

```jsx live=false
<Box border="8px" borderColor="red.500">
  Thick red border
</Box>
```

> If you're curious what theme styles you can override, please reference the
> [default theme foundation style files](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/tree/master/packages/theme/src/foundations).

### Modifying global styles

Global styles are changed in much the same way as components or foundational
styles. You can find them in the `theme.styles.global` object of the theme, like
such:

```jsx live=false
// theme.js
import theme from "@chakra-ui/theme"
import { merge } from "@chakra-ui/utils"

// You'll need the @chakra-ui/theme-tools to have access to the mode function
import { mode } from "@chakra-ui/theme-tools"

// Remember, you can access special theme variables if you
// declare a style as a function, rather than an object.
const overrides = {
  styles: {
    global: (props) => ({
      body: {
        fontFamily: "body",
        color: mode("gray.800", "whiteAlpha.900")(props),
        bg: mode("white", "gray.800")(props),
        lineHeight: "base",
      },
    }),
  },
}

// WARNING: If you do use a function in a style override, you will NOT
// inherit the existing styles like you will with an object.
// merge() will only merge objects, not functions
export default merge(theme, overrides)
```

## Scaling out your project

As your project grows in size, it's best to keep things organized. We highly
suggest that instead of a single `theme.js` (or `theme.ts`) file, that you
create a `/theme` folder in its place. Inside of this folder, you could have a
directory structure that looks like such:

```bash
/theme
  - index.js  # my main theme entrypoint
  - styles.js  # all my global style overrides
  /foundations
    - borders.js  # all my button overrides
  /components
    - button.js  # all my button overrides
```

This way, you can structure your main theme entrypoint file to be much cleaner,
like this:

```jsx live=false
// theme.js
import theme from "@chakra-ui/theme"
import { merge } from "@chakra-ui/utils"

// Global style overrides
import styles from "./styles.js"

// Foundational style overrides...
import border from "./foundations/borders"

// Component style overrides...
import Button from "./components/button"

const overrides = {
  styles,
  borders,
  // Other foundational style overrides go here...
  components: {
    Button,
    // Other components go here...
  },
}

export default merge(theme, overrides)
```

create your own components and integrate them into the Chakra system!
